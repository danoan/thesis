abstract = "This survey examines the state of the art of a variety of problems related to pseudo-Boolean optimization, i.e. to the optimization of set functions represented by closed algebraic expressions. The main parts of the survey examine general pseudo-Boolean optimization, the specially important case of quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization (to which every pseudo-Boolean optimization can be reduced), several other important special classes, and approximation algorithms."
